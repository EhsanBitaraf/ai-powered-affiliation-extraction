In this repository, we have used the [conference MIE dataset](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27174759) and transformed the affiliation information into a structured form through a pipeline designed with langflow (Fig. 1) using the gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 model. We used a [prompt](/docs/prompt1.md) for this purpose and received the outputs in json form. Then we analyzed it

# Data Availability
After modifying the [MIE Dataset](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27174759) and using LLM, a new structure called `structural_affiliations` was added to the previous dataset, which contains the following fields. The final dataset can be found [here](/data/dataset-mie.json).

structural_affiliations fields sample:
```json
  "structural_affiliations": [
      {
          "country": "",
          "institute": "",
          "department": "",
          "university": "",
          "city": "",
          "postalcode": "",
          "email": "",
          "Status": "",
          "universityf": ""
      }
  ]
