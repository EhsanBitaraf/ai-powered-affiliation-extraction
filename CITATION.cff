  This study employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze
  bibliometric data from European Medical Informatics
  conferences from 1996 to 2024. By enhancing traditional
  methods with LLM-based techniques, the researchers
  significantly improved affiliation extraction accuracy.
  The analysis reveals trends in publication volume, author
  impact, and institutional collaborations across Europe.
  Key findings include the identification of leading
  contributors, visualization of collaboration networks, and
  mapping of geographical and institutional centers of
  excellence. The study highlights the potential of LLMs in
  bibliometric analysis, offering deeper insights into
  research trends and collaborations while addressing
  challenges in data standardization and computational
  resources.
